step 1 : go to server----> open terminal ----> npm install ----> split the terminal 
step 2 : after spliting the terminal -----> go to client -----> npm install

now after doing this all the dependency of client and server side will get install 
then go to first terminal (aka server side terminal) ---> npm run server (this cmd start the server remeber server need to start first)
after starting the server go the 2nd terminal (aka client side terminal) ---> npm run dev ( which help to run the vite + React)

after doing that enjoy
